# Ford & LBJ Sentiment Analysis

Lydon B Johnson gave his state of the union address in 1964 and Ford in 1975. According to the data, LBJ had a 59% positivty rate (139/233 tokenized words) with his most frequent words used being 'faith' (8 times), 'good' (6 times) and 'create' (4 times). Likewise, Ford had a 61% positivity rate (230/378 tokenized words) with his most used words being 'public' (11), 'faith' (8) and 'time' (7). Both presidents had a fairly positive sentiment rate (Even though they both were not elected). I didn't output the graphs to a pdf right now, but running nrc_plot1 and nrc_plot2 both output barplots of the counts of sentiments for both presidents :)
